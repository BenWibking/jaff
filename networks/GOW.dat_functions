# This file contains special function definitions for the GOW network.
# The functions here are sympy translations of the implementation in
# https://github.com/PrincetonUniversity/athena/blob/chemistry_zsfr/src/chemistry/network/kida_network_files/gow17/kida_gow17.cpp

# There are two main types of functions found in this file:
# 1. Rate coefficient functions with names of the form @ratefunctionN
# where N indicates which reaction in the reaction list this rate
# coefficient is for (starting the count at N = 0), and
# 2. Change in thermal energy functions with names of the form @deltaEN,
# which give the change in gas thermal energy per occurence of reaction N,
# in units of eV, so positive values correspond to exothermic reactions
# and negative values to endothemic ones.

# Note that not every reaction is represented in this file. If there
# is no @ratefunction function for a given reaction number, that means
# the reaction rate does not use a customized functional form, and
# is instead derived from the standard chemical network format. If there
# is no deltaE function for a given reaction, that means that the change
# in gas thermal energy associated with that reaction is neglected and
# treated as approximately zero -- this might for example be the
# situation for an exothermic reaction but one where all the excess
# energy is given to a photon that then escapes.

# There are also other functions with names of the form @XXXX, which
# are helper functions that will be substituted into the expressions
# used in the @ratefunction and @deltaE functions. 

# A note to help interpret the rate coefficient functions: 
# rates in JAFF are always computed as k * n1 * n2 * ...,
# where n1, n2, ... are the number densities of the reactants. This
# is the correct expression most of the time, but some reactions
# scale with number density differently; for example, grain-assisted
# reactions generally have rates that go like n1 * nH * d2g, where
# nH = total H nucleus number density and d2g = dust to gas ratio.
# For these reactions, the rate coefficient expressions must be
# derived by solving k * n1 * n2 * ... = true rate, which is why
# we sometimes have number densities in the denominators for these
# reactions.
