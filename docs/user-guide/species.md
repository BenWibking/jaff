# Working with Species

## Overview

Species represent individual chemical entities (atoms, molecules, ions) in a chemical reaction network.

```python
from jaff import Network

net = Network("networks/react_COthin")

# Access species
for species in net.species:
    print(f"{species.name}: mass={species.mass:.2f} amu, charge={species.charge}")
```

## Species Attributes

Each species object has the following attributes:

| Attribute | Type  | Description                                      |
| --------- | ----- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `name`    | str   | Species identifier (e.g., "H2", "CO", "H+")      |
| `mass`    | float | Molecular mass in atomic mass units (amu)        |
| `charge`  | int   | Electric charge (0 for neutral, ±1, ±2 for ions) |
| `index`   | int   | Position in the species array                    |
| `fidx`    | str   | Formatted index name for code generation         |
| `latex`   | str   | Formatted latex representation of the specie     |

## Accessing Species

### By Index

```python
# Get first species
species = net.species[0]
print(f"First species: {species.name}")

# Iterate over all species
for i, species in enumerate(net.species):
    print(f"{i}: {species.name}")
```

### By Name

```python
# Fast lookup using dictionary
if "CO" in net.species_dict:
    idx = net.species_dict["CO"]
    co = net.species[idx]
    print(f"CO at index {idx}, mass={co.mass}")
else:
    print("CO not in network")
```

### Using Helper Methods

```python
# Get species object by name
co = net.get_species_object("CO")
print(f"CO: {co.mass} amu, charge={co.charge}")

# Get species index by name
idx = net.get_species_index("CO")
print(f"CO is at index {idx}")

# Get number of species
nspec = net.get_number_of_species()
print(f"Network has {nspec} species")
```

## Species Properties

### Mass

Molecular mass in atomic mass units:

```python
for species in net.species[:5]:
    print(f"{species.name}: {species.mass:.4f} amu")
```

### Charge

Electric charge state:

```python
# Find all ions
ions = [s for s in net.species if s.charge != 0]
print(f"Found {len(ions)} ions:")
for ion in ions[:5]:
    print(f"  {ion.name}: charge={ion.charge:+d}")

# Find neutral species
neutral = [s for s in net.species if s.charge == 0]
print(f"Found {len(neutral)} neutral species")
```

### Index

Array position for code generation:

```python
for species in net.species[:3]:
    print(f"{species.name} at index {species.index}")

# Use in generated code
from jaff import Codegen
cg = Codegen(network=net, lang="c++")
# Indices will be: 0, 1, 2, ... for C++
# Indices will be: 1, 2, 3, ... for Fortran
```

## Filtering Species

### By Mass Range

```python
# Find species between 10 and 50 amu
mid_mass = [s for s in net.species if 10 <= s.mass <= 50]
print(f"Species with mass 10-50 amu: {len(mid_mass)}")
for s in mid_mass[:5]:
    print(f"  {s.name}: {s.mass:.2f} amu")
```

### By Charge

```python
# Positive ions
cations = [s for s in net.species if s.charge > 0]

# Negative ions
anions = [s for s in net.species if s.charge < 0]

# Neutral
neutral = [s for s in net.species if s.charge == 0]

print(f"Cations: {len(cations)}")
print(f"Anions: {len(anions)}")
print(f"Neutral: {len(neutral)}")
```

### By Element

```python
from jaff.elements import Elements

elem = Elements(net)

# Get element truth matrix
truth_matrix = elem.get_element_truth_matrix()

# Find species containing carbon
if "C" in elem.elements:
    carbon_idx = elem.elements.index("C")
    carbon_species = [
        net.species[i] for i in range(len(net.species))
        if truth_matrix[i][carbon_idx]
    ]
    print(f"Species containing carbon: {len(carbon_species)}")
    for s in carbon_species[:5]:
        print(f"  {s.name}")
```

### By Name Pattern

```python
import re

# Find all H2X species
h2_species = [s for s in net.species if s.name.startswith("H2")]
print(f"H2X species: {[s.name for s in h2_species]}")

# Find species matching pattern
pattern = re.compile(r"C.*O")  # C followed by O
co_species = [s for s in net.species if pattern.match(s.name)]
print(f"C*O species: {[s.name for s in co_species]}")
```

## Species Statistics

### Mass Distribution

```python
import numpy as np

masses = [s.mass for s in net.species]

print(f"Average mass: {np.mean(masses):.2f} amu")
print(f"Mass range: {np.min(masses):.2f} - {np.max(masses):.2f} amu")
print(f"Median mass: {np.median(masses):.2f} amu")
```

### Charge Distribution

```python
from collections import Counter

charges = [s.charge for s in net.species]
charge_dist = Counter(charges)

for charge, count in sorted(charge_dist.items()):
    print(f"Charge {charge:+d}: {count} species")
```
